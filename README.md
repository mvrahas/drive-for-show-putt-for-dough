# Golf Skills Visualization

## About

A custom scatterplot to visualize the rankings of the top PGA Tour players between 1980 and 2014. It is interesting for exploring how different skills relate to a player's overall winnings for each year on the tour. I built this as my final project in an information visualization class at USC. The data is courtesy of [PGA Tour Shotlink](https://www.pgatour.com/stats/academicdata/shotlink.html)
